        <h1>Teja Kumar Muppala "acts in a play"</h1>
        <h5>Title: An Enemy of the People <br>
            Author: Henrik Ibsen</h5>
        <p>Dr. Stockmann. Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
            they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
            Mr. Billing!</p>
        <p>Billing. War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
            throats, Doctor!</p>
        <p>Dr. Stockmann. This article is only a beginning. I have already got
            four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?</p>
        <p>Billing (calls into the printing-room). Aslaksen, just come here for a
            minute!</p>
        <p>Hovstad. Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?</p>
        <p>
            Dr. Stockmann. Noâ€”far from it, my dear fellow. No, they are about
            quite another matter. But they all spring from the question of the
            water supply and the drainage. One thing leads to another, you know. It
            is like beginning to pull down an old house, exactly.</p>
        <p>Billing. Upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you
            have pulled all the old rubbish down.</p>
        <p>Aslaksen (coming in). Pulled down? You are not thinking of pulling down
            the Baths surely, Doctor?</p>
        <p>Hovstad. Far from it, don't be afraid.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stockmann. No, we meant something quite different. Well, what do
            you think of my article, Mr. Hovstad?</p>
